# Readme

This package establishes a quick way to transform Attoparsec parsers into iteratees ready to be used with the enumerator library. Special thanks go to the enumerator-iteratee package for inspiration and reference.

I hope it will be useful to people out there and please let me know if you encounter any issues with it.

I am hoping to provide a few examples soon under an /examples directory


## A Word on The Enumerator Package

The enumerator library is an alternative implementation of Oleg's iteratees.
